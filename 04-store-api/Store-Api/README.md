Using the new concept i learnt in Express , i built this store api that uses monogodb and  thus populate the mongodb with Json data and allows the user to perform the following
1.  Sort the data using any of the properties such as company, name, rating either in ascending or decsending order etc.  
2. Get the date of only the properties he wants to access 
3. Get access to certain fields such the company and name, or rating scale and  price depending on the fields the user wants to access. 
4. It allows the user to search for company names without typing the full company.  As the user types the characters fo the word he wants to serch for, the Api fetches all data that contains those particular characters.
5. The user can also limit the number of data the api fetches.
